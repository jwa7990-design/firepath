/**
 * FirePath — Financial Engine
 * =============================
 * Owns objective financial calculations only — "given these inputs, what are the
 * numbers." No opinion about which cards to show, what wording to use, or which
 * options are relevant to a given person — that's each page's own product logic,
 * built on top of what this file returns.
 *
 * Requires js/calculations.js to be loaded first (for calculateAgePension). Load
 * this file after it:
 *   <script src="js/calculations.js"></script>
 *   <script src="js/financial-engine.js"></script>
 *
 * Extracted from freedom-gap.html and freedom-options.html, which had independently
 * duplicated this same math — the real risk being that changing an assumption (the
 * 7% return rate, the 4% withdrawal rate) meant finding and updating it in more than
 * one place. This is now the single place that logic lives.
